# Vue 2 Todo to Vue 3 Nuxt Migration

This guide explains how to migrate your Vue 2 Todo application to Vue 3 using the Nuxt framework, step by step.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone Your Vue 2 Todo App**: If you haven't already, make sure to clone your Vue 2 Todo application repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Update Dependencies**: Update your `package.json` to include Vue 3 and Nuxt. Ensure that you have Nuxt version 2.16 or a compatible version.

    ```json
    "dependencies": {
      "vue": "^3.0.0",
      "nuxt": "^2.16.0",
      // ...
    }
    ```

4. **Update Vue 2 Syntax to Vue 3**: Start by converting your Vue 2 code to use Vue 3 syntax. Replace options API with the Composition API and update component options like `data` and `methods` to use the Composition API's `setup` function, `ref`, and `computed` when necessary.

5. **Create a New Nuxt Application**: If you haven't already, create a new Nuxt application by running:

    ```bash
    npx create-nuxt-app my-nuxt-todo-app
    ```

    Follow the setup instructions and configure your Nuxt application as needed.

6. **Review Project Structure**: Compare your Vue 2 project structure with the Nuxt project structure. Adjust your project structure to align with Nuxt's conventions.

## Migration Steps

1. **Migrate Components**: Convert your Vue 2 components to Vue 3 Composition API. Refactor the component code to use the Composition API's `setup` function, replace `data` with `ref`, and update Vue 2 directives like `v-bind` and `v-on` to Vue 3 equivalents.

2. **Migrate Routing**: If your Vue 2 application used Vue Router, you need to migrate to Nuxt's routing system. Remove Vue Router and configure routes using Nuxt's `pages` directory and the `nuxt-link` component.

3. **Update Vuex Store**: If your Vue 2 app used Vuex for state management, adapt your store to work with Nuxt's store module. Create a store module in the `store` directory of your Nuxt app and integrate it with your components.

4. **Testing and Debugging**: Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected with the new Vue 3 and Nuxt setup. Utilize Vue Devtools and Nuxt's debugging tools for assistance.

5. **Styling and CSS**: Review and update your CSS to ensure compatibility with the new project structure and Vue 3/Nuxt features.

6. **Plugins and Middleware**: Review and update any custom plugins and middleware to work seamlessly with the new Vue 3 and Nuxt setup.

7. **Data Fetching**: Adapt data fetching methods or API calls to work with Nuxt's data fetching mechanisms, such as asyncData, fetch, and serverMiddleware.

8. **Gradual Update**: Consider making the migration incrementally by starting with smaller components or less critical parts of your application.

9. **Continuous Testing**: Continuously test and monitor your application as you update different parts to catch any issues early.

10. **Final Testing and Optimization**: Conduct a final round of testing to ensure the entire application functions as expected. Optimize your code and address any performance issues.

11. **Documentation and Communication**: Update your documentation and communicate the migration process and changes to your team members or users.

Remember that the migration process may vary depending on your specific project and its dependencies, so adapt these steps as needed. Additionally, check for any official migration guides or tools provided by the Vue and Nuxt communities to facilitate the process.
